I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Glasgow, with a passion for developing innovative and customer-focused solutions. With a solid foundation in programming, web development, and computer architecture, I thrive in environments where I can apply my skills to solve complex challenges and deliver high-quality products that meet client needs.

I am excited about opportunities where I can collaborate with talented teams to develop products that make a meaningful impact for businesses and their customers. I bring a mix of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a customer-centric approach, and I look forward to contributing to dynamic and innovative projects.
